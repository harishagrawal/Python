Scenario 1: Test when both numbers are positive and not equal
Details:
  TestName: test_extended_gcd_positive_unequal_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct computation of the extended_gcd for two positive unequal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: Invoke the extended_gcd function with two positive unequal integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple contains three integers and that their values are correct according to the Extended Euclid's Algorithm.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the typical use case of computing the extended GCD of two positive unequal numbers. This is a critical aspect of the function's specification and the main intended use case.

Scenario 2: Test when both numbers are equal
Details:
  TestName: test_extended_gcd_equal_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct computation of the extended_gcd for two equal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: Invoke the extended_gcd function with two equal integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple contains three integers and that their values are correct according to the Extended Euclid's Algorithm.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the edge case of computing the extended GCD of two equal numbers. This edge case is important because it may reveal potential issues in the implementation of the function.

Scenario 3: Test when one of the numbers is zero
Details:
  TestName: test_extended_gcd_zero_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct computation of the extended_gcd when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: Invoke the extended_gcd function with one integer and zero as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple contains three integers and that their values are correct according to the Extended Euclid's Algorithm.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the edge case of computing the extended GCD when one of the numbers is zero. This edge case is important because it may reveal potential issues in the function's handling of zero values.

Scenario 4: Test when both numbers are zero
Details:
  TestName: test_extended_gcd_both_zeros
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct computation of the extended_gcd when both numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: Invoke the extended_gcd function with both parameters as zero.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple contains three integers and that their values are correct according to the Extended Euclid's Algorithm.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles the edge case of computing the extended GCD when both numbers are zero. This edge case is important because it may reveal potential issues in the function's handling of zero values.
