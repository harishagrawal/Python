Scenario 1: Testing the function with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_diophantine_with_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the diophantine function correctly solves the equation for positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is needed as we are passing the values directly.
  Act: The function will be invoked with three positive integers as parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome will be a tuple of two floats, which is the solution of the equation.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function works correctly with positive integers. The result should match the solution of the equation according to the mathematical rules.

Scenario 2: Testing the function with negative integers
Details:
