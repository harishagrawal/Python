```
Scenario 1: Test with empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_recursive_with_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify the handling of an empty list as input, which is an edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed.
  Act: Invoke the function permute_recursive with an empty list as parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a nested empty list [[]].
Validation:
  This is an important test as it checks if the function can handle edge cases like an empty list without throwing an error. According to the function's specifications, it should return a nested empty list when the input is an empty list.

Scenario 2: Test with a single element list
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_recursive_with_single_element_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behaviour when there's only one element in the list. The only permutation of a single element list is itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed.
  Act: Invoke the function permute_recursive with a list that only contains one element.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a nested list with the list itself.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles the case when there's only one element in the list. It is important because the permutation of a single element list is a basic case.

Scenario 3: Test with a list of two elements
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_recursive_with_two_element_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates all permutations for a list that contains two elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed.
  Act: Invoke the function permute_recursive with a list that contains two elements.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a list of all possible permutations of the two elements.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly generates all the permutations for a list with two elements. It is important because it tests the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 4: Test with a list of three elements
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_recursive_with_three_element_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates all permutations for a list that contains three elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed.
  Act: Invoke the function permute_recursive with a list that contains three elements.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a list of all possible permutations of the three elements.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly generates all the permutations for a list with three elements. It is important because it tests the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 5: Test with a list of four elements
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_recursive_with_four_element_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates all permutations for a list that contains four elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed.
  Act: Invoke the function permute_recursive with a list that contains four elements.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a list of all possible permutations of the four elements.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly generates all the permutations for a list with four elements. It validates the function's ability to handle more complex cases.
