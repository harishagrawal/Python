Scenario 1: Testing partition function with integers
Details:
  TestName: test_partition_with_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct functionality of the partition function when a list of integers is given as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers and the low and high index values.
  Act: Invoke the partition function with the list of integers as the first parameter, and the low and high index values as the second and third parameters respectively.
  Assert: The returned value should be the index of the pivot element after partitioning.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the partition function with integer values, which is a common use case.

Scenario 2: Testing partition function with strings
Details:
  TestName: test_partition_with_strings
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct functionality of the partition function when a list of strings is given as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of strings and the low and high index values.
  Act: Invoke the partition function with the list of strings as the first parameter, and the low and high index values as the second and third parameters respectively.
  Assert: The returned value should be the index of the pivot element after partitioning.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the functionality of the partition function with string values, which is a less common but still valid use case.

Scenario 3: Testing partition function with floats
Details:
  TestName: test_partition_with_floats
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct functionality of the partition function when a list of floats is given as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of floats and the low and high index values.
  Act: Invoke the partition function with the list of floats as the first parameter, and the low and high index values as the second and third parameters respectively.
  Assert: The returned value should be the index of the pivot element after partitioning.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the functionality of the partition function with float values, which is another common use case.

Scenario 4: Testing partition function with empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_partition_with_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the partition function when an empty list is given as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list and the low and high index values.
  Act: Invoke the partition function with the empty list as the first parameter, and the low and high index values as the second and third parameters respectively.
  Assert: The function should return an error or handle this case appropriately.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the functionality of the partition function when given an edge case input.

Scenario 5: Testing partition function with low and high index out of range
Details:
  TestName: test_partition_with_index_out_of_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the partition function when the low and high index values are out of range of the input list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list and the low and high index values that are out of range.
  Act: Invoke the partition function with the list as the first parameter, and the out of range low and high index values as the second and third parameters respectively.
  Assert: The function should return an error or handle this case appropriately.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the functionality of the partition function when given an edge case input.
