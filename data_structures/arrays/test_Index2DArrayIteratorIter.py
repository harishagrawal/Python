Scenario 1: Validating the correct sequential order of elements
Details:
  TestName: test_iter_sequential_order
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __iter__ method correctly iterates over the elements of the 2D array in the expected order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D array with known elements.
  Act: Invoke the __iter__ method and collect the output into a tuple or list.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected sequence of elements.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the __iter__ method correctly follows the core business requirement of sequential iteration over a 2D array. If the elements are not returned in the correct order, subsequent operations on the data may produce incorrect results.

Scenario 2: Validating the correct handling of empty arrays
Details:
  TestName: test_iter_empty_array
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __iter__ method correctly handles an empty 2D array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty 2D array.
  Act: Invoke the __iter__ method and collect the output into a tuple or list.
  Assert: Check that the output is an empty sequence.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the __iter__ method correctly handles edge cases, specifically an empty 2D array. If the method does not correctly handle this case, it may lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions when processing empty data sets.

Scenario 3: Validating the correct handling of arrays with varying row lengths
Details:
  TestName: test_iter_varying_row_lengths
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __iter__ method correctly handles a 2D array in which the rows have varying lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D array with rows of varying lengths.
  Act: Invoke the __iter__ method and collect the output into a tuple or list.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected sequence of elements.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the __iter__ method correctly handles edge cases, specifically a 2D array with rows of varying lengths. If the method does not correctly handle this case, it may lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions when processing irregular data sets.

Scenario 4: Validating the correctness of the iter object
Details:
  TestName: test_iter_correctness
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the __iter__ method returns an iterator object that can be correctly used with Python's built-in functions like next() and iter().
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D array with known elements.
  Act: Invoke the __iter__ method, use the returned object with next() and iter() functions.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected sequence of elements.
Validation:
  This test verifies the correctness of the iterator object returned by the __iter__ method. If the method does not return a valid iterator, it may lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions when the iterator is used with Python's built-in functions.
