Scenario 1: Test when values is False
Details:
  TestName: test_values_false
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's response when values is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a variable, values, to False.
  Act: Invoke the search function with values as the parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to return False as it failed earlier.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can correctly handle a case where a failure occurred earlier.

Scenario 2: Test when all squares have only one possible value
Details:
  TestName: test_all_squares_have_one_value
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's response when all squares have only one possible value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a variable, values, such that all squares have only one possible value.
  Act: Invoke the search function with values as the parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to return values as the Sudoku is solved.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can correctly handle a case where the Sudoku is solved.

Scenario 3: Test when there is an unfilled square with the fewest possibilities
Details:
  TestName: test_unfilled_square_fewest_possibilities
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to choose the unfilled square with the fewest possibilities and try all possible values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a variable, values, such that there is at least one unfilled square with multiple possible values.
  Act: Invoke the search function with values as the parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to return a solution if one exists, or False if no solution exists.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can correctly handle a case where there are unfilled squares and attempt to solve the Sudoku.

Scenario 4: Test when no solution exists
Details:
  TestName: test_no_solution_exists
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's response when no solution exists for the given Sudoku.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a variable, values, such that no solution exists for the given Sudoku.
  Act: Invoke the search function with values as the parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to return False as no solution exists.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can correctly handle a case where no solution exists for the given Sudoku.

Scenario 5: Test when multiple solutions exist
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_solutions_exist
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to find a solution when multiple solutions exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a variable, values, such that multiple solutions exist for the given Sudoku.
  Act: Invoke the search function with values as the parameter.
  Assert: The function is expected to return a solution if one exists.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can correctly handle a case where multiple solutions exist for the given Sudoku.
