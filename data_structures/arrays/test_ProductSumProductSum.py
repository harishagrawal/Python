```
Scenario 1: Test for a simple flat list without any nested lists.
Details:
  TestName: test_product_sum_flat_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a simple flat list without any nested lists correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list without any nested lists and a depth value.
  Act: Call the product_sum function with the initialized list and depth.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the list elements multiplied by the depth.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the basic functionality of the function. The expected result is the sum of the elements of the list multiplied by the depth, which aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test for a list with nested lists.
Details:
  TestName: test_product_sum_nested_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a list with nested lists correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with nested lists and a depth value.
  Act: Call the product_sum function with the initialized list and depth.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the list elements multiplied by their respective depths.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle nested lists. The expected result is the sum of the elements of the list multiplied by their respective depths, which aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Test for a list with negative and positive numbers.
Details:
  TestName: test_product_sum_negative_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a list with both negative and positive numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with both negative and positive numbers and a depth value.
  Act: Call the product_sum function with the initialized list and depth.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the list elements multiplied by the depth.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle lists with both negative and positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of the elements of the list multiplied by the depth, which aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Test for a list with floating-point numbers.
Details:
  TestName: test_product_sum_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a list with floating-point numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with floating-point numbers and a depth value.
  Act: Call the product_sum function with the initialized list and depth.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the list elements multiplied by the depth.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle lists with floating-point numbers. The expected result is the sum of the elements of the list multiplied by the depth, which aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 5: Test for a list with zero depth.
Details:
  TestName: test_product_sum_zero_depth
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles a list with a depth of zero correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list and set the depth to zero.
  Act: Call the product_sum function with the initialized list and depth.
  Assert: The result should be zero, regardless of the elements in the list.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle a list with a depth of zero. The expected result is zero, regardless of the elements in the list, which aligns with the function's specifications.
