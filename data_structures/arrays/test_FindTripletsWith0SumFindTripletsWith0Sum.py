```
Scenario 1: Test with a list that contains at least one triplet that sums to zero
Details:
  TestName: test_find_triplets_with_0_sum_positive
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies and returns a list of triplets from the input list that sum to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with values [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4].
  Act: Call the find_triplets_with_0_sum function with the initialized list.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a list containing two triplets [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]].
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly finds and returns the triplets from an input list that sum to zero. This is a crucial functionality of the function as per the business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_find_triplets_with_0_sum_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles an empty list input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list.
  Act: Call the find_triplets_with_0_sum function with the empty list.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is an empty list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases, specifically an empty list as input. It validates that the function does not throw an error and instead returns an empty list, as per the business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test with a list that contains only zeros
Details:
  TestName: test_find_triplets_with_0_sum_zeros
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles a list that contains only zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with three zeros [0, 0, 0].
  Act: Call the find_triplets_with_0_sum function with the initialized list.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a list containing one triplet [[0, 0, 0]].
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles a list that contains only zeros. It confirms that the function returns a triplet of zeros, adhering to the business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test with a list that does not contain any triplet that sums to zero
Details:
  TestName: test_find_triplets_with_0_sum_no_zero_sum
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles a list that does not contain any triplet that sums to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
  Act: Call the find_triplets_with_0_sum function with the initialized list.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is an empty list.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles a list that does not contain any triplet that sums to zero. It confirms that the function does not return any false positives, which is crucial to meet the business requirements.
