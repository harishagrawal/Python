Scenario 1: Test when all elements in the sequence are False
Details:
  TestName: test_all_elements_false
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns False when all elements in the sequence are False. This is an edge case as it is the minimum true value that can be returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sequence with all elements as False.
  Act: Invoke the function with the sequence as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with the minimum possible true value. The expected result is False, which aligns with the function's specification to return some element of seq that is true.

Scenario 2: Test when the sequence contains at least one true element
Details:
  TestName: test_at_least_one_true_element
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns the first true element when the sequence contains at least one true element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sequence with at least one true element.
  Act: Invoke the function with the sequence as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the first true element.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's behavior when the sequence contains true elements. The expected result is the first true element, which aligns with the function's specification to return some element of seq that is true.

Scenario 3: Test when the sequence is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_sequence
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns False when the sequence is empty. This is an edge case as it is the minimum number of elements that a sequence can have.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty sequence.
  Act: Invoke the function with the sequence as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with the minimum number of elements. The expected result is False, which aligns with the function's specification to return some element of seq that is true.

Scenario 4: Test when the sequence contains mixed elements (true and false)
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_elements
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns the first true element when the sequence contains mixed elements (both true and false).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sequence with mixed elements (both true and false).
  Act: Invoke the function with the sequence as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the first true element.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's behavior when the sequence contains mixed elements. The expected result is the first true element, which aligns with the function's specification to return some element of seq that is true.
