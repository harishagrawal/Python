Scenario 1: Validate the function with expected input
Details:
  TestName: test_grid_values_with_expected_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function grid_values correctly converts a grid into a dictionary with the correct keys and values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a grid of 81 characters with '0' or '.' representing empty squares.
  Act: Invoke the function grid_values with the initialized grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a dictionary with 81 key-value pairs, where keys are squares and values are characters from the grid.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it validates the basic functionality of the function with normal input. The expected result is in line with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validate the function with unexpected input
Details:
  TestName: test_grid_values_with_unexpected_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function grid_values raises an AssertionError when the grid does not have 81 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a grid of less than or more than 81 characters.
  Act: Invoke the function grid_values with the initialized grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that an AssertionError is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it checks that the function correctly handles input that does not meet its requirements. The expected result is in line with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate the function with a grid containing characters other than '0' or '.'
Details:
  TestName: test_grid_values_with_invalid_characters
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function grid_values correctly ignores characters in the grid that are not '0' or '.'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a grid of 81 characters, some of which are not '0' or '.'.
  Act: Invoke the function grid_values with the initialized grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned dictionary only contains keys for characters that were '0' or '.' in the grid.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important because it checks that the function correctly handles grids with invalid characters. The expected result is in line with the function's specifications and business requirements.
