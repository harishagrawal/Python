Scenario 1: Testing if function correctly solves a valid grid
Details:
  TestName: test_solve_all_valid_grid
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function solve_all correctly solves a valid sudoku grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of valid sudoku grids.
  Act: Invoke the function solve_all with the list of valid sudoku grids as parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly solved all the sudoku grids.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the main functionality of the solve_all function, which is to solve a list of sudoku grids. The expected result is that all the grids are solved, which aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Testing if function correctly measures execution time
Details:
  TestName: test_solve_all_execution_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function solve_all correctly measures the execution time for each grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of valid sudoku grids.
  Act: Invoke the function solve_all with the list of valid sudoku grids as parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly measured and returned the execution time for each grid.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function correctly measures and returns the execution time for each grid, which is a part of the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Testing if function correctly handles an empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_solve_all_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function solve_all correctly handles an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the function solve_all with the empty list as parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly handled the empty list and did not return any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function correctly handles edge cases, like an empty list. The expected result is that the function does not return any errors, which aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Testing if function correctly handles invalid grids
Details:
  TestName: test_solve_all_invalid_grids
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function solve_all correctly handles invalid sudoku grids.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of invalid sudoku grids.
  Act: Invoke the function solve_all with the list of invalid sudoku grids as parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly handled the invalid grids and did not return any errors.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the function correctly handles error conditions, like invalid sudoku grids. The expected result is that the function does not return any errors, which aligns with the function's specifications.
