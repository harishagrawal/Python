Scenario 1: Validate the function with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_pairs_with_sum_positive_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly identify and count pairs of positive integers in the input array that sum up to the required sum.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of positive integers and a required sum.
  Act: Invoke the pairs_with_sum function with the initialized array and required sum as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned count of pairs is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function with positive integers. The expected result is based on the manual calculation of pairs that sum up to the required sum.

Scenario 2: Validate the function with negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_pairs_with_sum_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly identify and count pairs of negative integers in the input array that sum up to the required sum.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of negative integers and a required sum.
  Act: Invoke the pairs_with_sum function with the initialized array and required sum as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned count of pairs is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle negative integers. The expected result is based on the manual calculation of pairs that sum up to the required sum.

Scenario 3: Validate the function with an array containing both positive and negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_pairs_with_sum_mixed_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly identify and count pairs of integers in the input array that sum up to the required sum, where the array contains both positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of mixed integers (both positive and negative) and a required sum.
  Act: Invoke the pairs_with_sum function with the initialized array and required sum as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned count of pairs is as expected.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle arrays with mixed integers. The expected result is based on the manual calculation of pairs that sum up to the required sum.

Scenario 4: Validate the function with an empty array 
Details:
  TestName: test_pairs_with_sum_empty_array
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to handle an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty array and a required sum.
  Act: Invoke the pairs_with_sum function with the initialized array and required sum as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned count of pairs is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle empty arrays. The expected result is zero, as there are no pairs in an empty array.

Scenario 5: Validate the function with an array of size one
Details:
  TestName: test_pairs_with_sum_array_of_size_one
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to handle an array of size one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array of size one and a required sum.
  Act: Invoke the pairs_with_sum function with the initialized array and required sum as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned count of pairs is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle arrays of size one. The expected result is zero, as there are no pairs in an array of size one.
