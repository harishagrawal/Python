Scenario 1: Test with a fully solved puzzle
Details:
  TestName: test_solved_with_solved_puzzle
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the `solved` function correctly identifies a fully solved puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a fully solved puzzle with each unit as a permutation of the digits 1 to 9.
  Act: Call the `solved` function with the solved puzzle as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the `solved` function. If a fully solved puzzle is given as input, the function should be able to identify it as such.

Scenario 2: Test with an unsolved puzzle
Details:
  TestName: test_solved_with_unsolved_puzzle
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the `solved` function correctly identifies an unsolved puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an unsolved puzzle with at least one unit not being a permutation of the digits 1 to 9.
  Act: Call the `solved` function with the unsolved puzzle as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test is critical as it checks if the `solved` function can correctly identify an unsolved puzzle. If an unsolved puzzle is given as input, the function should return `False`.

Scenario 3: Test with a puzzle having duplicate digits in a unit
Details:
  TestName: test_solved_with_duplicate_digits_in_unit
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the `solved` function correctly identifies a puzzle with duplicate digits in a unit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a puzzle with at least one unit having duplicate digits.
  Act: Call the `solved` function with the puzzle as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks if the `solved` function can correctly identify a puzzle where a unit has duplicate digits. Such a puzzle is not valid and the function should return `False`.

Scenario 4: Test with a puzzle having missing digits in a unit
Details:
  TestName: test_solved_with_missing_digits_in_unit
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the `solved` function correctly identifies a puzzle with missing digits in a unit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a puzzle with at least one unit missing some digits.
  Act: Call the `solved` function with the puzzle as an argument.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it checks if the `solved` function can correctly identify a puzzle where a unit is missing some digits. Such a puzzle is not valid and the function should return `False`.
