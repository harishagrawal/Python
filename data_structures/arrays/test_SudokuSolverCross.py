Scenario 1: Cross product of non-empty lists
Details:
  TestName: test_cross_product_of_non_empty_lists
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly computes the cross product of two non-empty lists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two non-empty lists of integers or strings.
  Act: Invoke the cross function, passing the two lists as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned list matches the expected cross product of the two input lists.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the basic functionality of the cross function with typical input data. The expected result is derived from the definition of the cross product operation.

Scenario 2: Cross product of an empty list and a non-empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_cross_product_of_empty_and_non_empty_lists
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when one of the input lists is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one empty list and one non-empty list of integers or strings.
  Act: Call the cross function, passing the two lists as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  This test is critical to confirm that the function handles edge cases properly. According to the definition of the cross product, the cross product of an empty set and any other set is an empty set.

Scenario 3: Cross product of two empty lists
Details:
  TestName: test_cross_product_of_two_empty_lists
  Description: This test validates the function's behavior when both input lists are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two empty lists.
  Act: Call the cross function, passing the two lists as parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to check that the function handles the edge case of two empty input lists correctly. The expected result is derived from the definition of the cross product operation.

Scenario 4: Cross product of lists with duplicate items
Details:
  TestName: test_cross_product_of_lists_with_duplicates
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input lists contain duplicate items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two lists of integers or strings, each containing at least one duplicate item.
  Act: Invoke the cross function, passing the two lists as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned list includes the cross product of all items, including duplicates.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles input lists with duplicate items. The expected result is derived from the definition of the cross product operation, which does not eliminate duplicates.
