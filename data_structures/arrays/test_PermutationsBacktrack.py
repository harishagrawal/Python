Scenario 1: Test Backtrack Function with Start at 0
Details:
  TestName: test_backtrack_start_zero
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the backtrack function correctly generates permutations when the start value is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of numbers and an empty list for output.
  Act: Invoke the backtrack function with the start value as 0.
  Assert: Check that the output list contains all permutations of the input list.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the backtrack function is working properly when the start value is 0. The result should match the expected output based on the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test Backtrack Function with Start at Middle
Details:
  TestName: test_backtrack_start_middle
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the backtrack function correctly generates permutations when the start value is at the middle of the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of numbers and an empty list for output.
  Act: Invoke the backtrack function with the start value as the middle index of the list.
  Assert: Check that the output list contains all permutations of the input list starting from the middle index.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the backtrack function is capable of generating correct permutations even when the start value is not at the beginning. The result should match the expected output based on the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test Backtrack Function with Start at End
Details:
  TestName: test_backtrack_start_end
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the backtrack function correctly handles the scenario where the start value is at the end of the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of numbers and an empty list for output.
  Act: Invoke the backtrack function with the start value as the last index of the list.
  Assert: Check that the output list contains only the original list as there are no more permutations possible.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the backtrack function handles edge cases correctly. The result should match the expected output based on the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test Backtrack Function with Empty List
Details:
  TestName: test_backtrack_empty_list
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the backtrack function correctly handles the scenario where the input list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list for numbers and output.
  Act: Invoke the backtrack function with the start value as 0.
  Assert: Check that the output list remains empty as there are no permutations possible for an empty list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the backtrack function is capable of handling edge cases where the input list is empty. The result should match the expected output based on the function's specifications and business requirements.
