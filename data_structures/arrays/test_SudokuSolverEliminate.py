Scenario 1: Test elimination of a value that is not present in the square
Details:
  TestName: test_eliminate_nonexistent_value
  Description: This test will verify if the function correctly handles the case where the value to be eliminated is not present in the square.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a dictionary with some keys and values where the value to be eliminated is not present in the square.
  Act: Call the eliminate function with this dictionary, a key, and a value to be eliminated.
  Assert: Check if the returned dictionary is equal to the initial dictionary.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the value to be eliminated is not present in the square. If the function does not correctly handle this case, it could lead to incorrect results.

Scenario 2: Test elimination of a value that results in a contradiction
Details:
  TestName: test_eliminate_leads_to_contradiction
  Description: This test will verify if the function correctly handles the case where the elimination of a value leads to a contradiction (i.e., a square with no values left).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a dictionary with some keys and values where the elimination of a value would lead to a contradiction.
  Act: Call the eliminate function with this dictionary, a key, and a value to be eliminated.
  Assert: Check if the function returns False.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies contradictions. If the function does not correctly identify contradictions, it could lead to incorrect results.

Scenario 3: Test propagation when a square is reduced to one value
Details:
  TestName: test_eliminate_propagate_one_value
  Description: This test will verify if the function correctly propagates when a square is reduced to one value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a dictionary with some keys and values where the elimination of a value would reduce a square to one value.
  Act: Call the eliminate function with this dictionary, a key, and a value to be eliminated.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected dictionary after propagation.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly propagates when a square is reduced to one value. If the function does not correctly propagate, it could lead to incorrect results.

Scenario 4: Test propagation when a unit is reduced to only one place for a value
Details:
  TestName: test_eliminate_propagate_one_place
  Description: This test will verify if the function correctly propagates when a unit is reduced to only one place for a value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a dictionary with some keys and values where the elimination of a value would reduce a unit to one place for a value.
  Act: Call the eliminate function with this dictionary, a key, and a value to be eliminated.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected dictionary after propagation.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly propagates when a unit is reduced to only one place for a value. If the function does not correctly propagate, it could lead to incorrect results.
