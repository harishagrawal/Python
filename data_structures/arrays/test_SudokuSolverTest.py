Scenario 1: Test if the length of squares is equal to 81
Details:
  TestName: test_squares_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the length of the squares is as expected, i.e., 81. This is a crucial part of the business logic as it confirms the total number of squares in a sudoku puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the squares variable.
  Act: Call the test() function.
  Assert: Check if the length of the squares is 81.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the squares variable is initialized with the correct number of squares. The expected result is in line with the standard size of a sudoku puzzle.

Scenario 2: Test if the length of unitlist is equal to 27
Details:
  TestName: test_unitlist_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the length of the unitlist is as expected, i.e., 27. This is a crucial part of the business logic as it confirms the total number of units in a sudoku puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the unitlist variable.
  Act: Call the test() function.
  Assert: Check if the length of the unitlist is 27.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the unitlist variable is initialized with the correct number of units. The expected result is in line with the standard size of a sudoku puzzle.

Scenario 3: Test if all squares have 3 units
Details:
  TestName: test_units_per_square
  Description: This test is intended to verify if all squares in the sudoku puzzle have exactly 3 units. This is a crucial part of the business logic as it confirms the correct setup of the puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the units variable.
  Act: Call the test() function.
  Assert: Check if all squares have 3 units.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that each square is associated with the correct number of units. The expected result is in line with the standard setup of a sudoku puzzle.

Scenario 4: Test if all squares have 20 peers
Details:
  TestName: test_peers_per_square
  Description: This test is intended to verify if all squares in the sudoku puzzle have exactly 20 peers. This is a crucial part of the business logic as it confirms the correct setup of the puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the peers variable.
  Act: Call the test() function.
  Assert: Check if all squares have 20 peers.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that each square is associated with the correct number of peers. The expected result is in line with the standard setup of a sudoku puzzle.

Scenario 5: Test the units and peers of a specific square
Details:
  TestName: test_specific_square
  Description: This test is intended to verify if a specific square, "C2", has the correct units and peers. This is a crucial part of the business logic as it confirms the correct setup of the puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the units and peers variables.
  Act: Call the test() function.
  Assert: Check if the units and peers of square "C2" are as expected.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that a specific square is associated with the correct units and peers. The expected result is in line with the standard setup of a sudoku puzzle.
