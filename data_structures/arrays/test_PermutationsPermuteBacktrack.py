Scenario 1: Test the permute_backtrack function with a list of unique integers
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_backtrack_with_unique_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the permute_backtrack function correctly generates all permutations of a list of unique integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of unique integers.
  Act: Call the permute_backtrack function, passing the list of unique integers as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list contains all permutations of the input list.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the basic functionality of the permute_backtrack function. The expected result is a list of all permutations of the input list, which aligns with the function's specification and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test the permute_backtrack function with an empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_backtrack_with_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the permute_backtrack function correctly handles an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list.
  Act: Call the permute_backtrack function, passing the empty list as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list is also empty.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's handling of edge cases. The expected result is an empty list, as there are no permutations of an empty list. This aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test the permute_backtrack function with a list of duplicate integers
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_backtrack_with_duplicate_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the permute_backtrack function correctly generates all permutations of a list containing duplicate integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers containing duplicates.
  Act: Call the permute_backtrack function, passing the list of integers as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list contains all permutations of the input list, including permutations that are identical due to the presence of duplicate integers.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's handling of lists containing duplicate integers. The expected result is a list of all permutations of the input list, including identical permutations. This aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test the permute_backtrack function with a list containing a single integer
Details:
  TestName: test_permute_backtrack_with_single_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the permute_backtrack function correctly handles a list containing a single integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list containing a single integer.
  Act: Call the permute_backtrack function, passing the list as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list contains a single permutation, which is identical to the input list.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's handling of edge cases. The expected result is a list containing a single permutation, which is identical to the input list. This aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.
