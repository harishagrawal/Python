Scenario 1: Test if a shuffled sequence is not equal to the original sequence.
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_not_equal_to_original
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffled sequence is not equal to the original sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sequence.
  Act: Call the shuffled function with the initialized sequence.
  Assert: Check if the shuffled sequence is not equal to the original sequence.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: The shuffled function is expected to return a sequence that is a shuffled version of the original sequence. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the shuffled sequence is not equal to the original sequence.

Scenario 2: Test if the shuffled sequence contains all elements from the original sequence.
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_contains_all_elements
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffled sequence contains all elements from the original sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sequence.
  Act: Call the shuffled function with the initialized sequence.
  Assert: Check if the shuffled sequence contains all elements from the original sequence.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: The shuffled function is expected to return a sequence that is a shuffled version of the original sequence. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the shuffled sequence contains all elements from the original sequence.

Scenario 3: Test if the shuffled sequence has the same length as the original sequence.
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_same_length_as_original
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffled sequence has the same length as the original sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a sequence.
  Act: Call the shuffled function with the initialized sequence.
  Assert: Check if the shuffled sequence has the same length as the original sequence.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: The shuffled function is expected to return a sequence that is a shuffled version of the original sequence. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the shuffled sequence has the same length as the original sequence.

Scenario 4: Test if the shuffled function can handle an empty sequence.
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_empty_sequence
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffled function can handle an empty sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty sequence.
  Act: Call the shuffled function with the empty sequence.
  Assert: Check if the shuffled function returns an empty sequence.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: The shuffled function should be able to handle an empty sequence and return an empty sequence.
