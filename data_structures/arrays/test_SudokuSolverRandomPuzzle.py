```
Scenario 1: Test that random_puzzle generates a puzzle with the default number of assignments
Details:
  TestName: test_random_puzzle_default_assignments
  Description: This test will verify that the random_puzzle function generates a puzzle with the default number of assignments (17).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the random_puzzle function without any parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned puzzle has at least 17 assignments.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves as expected when no parameters are provided. The puzzle created should have at least 17 assignments, as per the business logic of the function.

Scenario 2: Test that random_puzzle generates a puzzle with a specific number of assignments
Details:
  TestName: test_random_puzzle_specific_assignments
  Description: This test will verify that the random_puzzle function generates a puzzle with a specified number of assignments.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the random_puzzle function with a specific number of assignments.
  Assert: Check that the returned puzzle has at least the specified number of assignments.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves as expected when a specific number of assignments are requested. The puzzle created should have at least the number of assignments specified.

Scenario 3: Test that random_puzzle generates a puzzle with unique assignments
Details:
  TestName: test_random_puzzle_unique_assignments
  Description: This test will verify that the random_puzzle function generates a puzzle with unique assignments.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the random_puzzle function with a specific number of assignments.
  Assert: Check that the returned puzzle has unique assignments.
Validation:
  This is an important test as it checks that the function is creating a valid puzzle. According to the business logic of the function, each assignment in the puzzle should be unique.

Scenario 4: Test that random_puzzle retries on contradictions
Details:
  TestName: test_random_puzzle_retries_on_contradictions
  Description: This test will verify that the random_puzzle function retries and generates a new puzzle when it encounters a contradiction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the assign function to return False, indicating a contradiction.
  Act: Invoke the random_puzzle function.
  Assert: Check that the function was called more than once, indicating a retry.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to handle contradictions, which is a critical part of its business logic. If a contradiction is encountered, the function should retry and generate a new puzzle.
