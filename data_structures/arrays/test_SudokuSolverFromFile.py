Scenario 1: Valid File with Strings Separated by Newline
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_file_with_strings_separated_by_newline
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly reads a valid file and returns a list of strings separated by newline.
Execution:
  Arrange: A file with strings separated by newline will be created.
  Act: The function will be invoked using the filename of the created file and the default separator.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a list of strings. The list will be compared with the expected list.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the basic functionality of reading a file and returning a list of strings separated by newline. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Valid File with Strings Separated by Custom Separator
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_file_with_strings_separated_by_custom_separator
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly reads a valid file and returns a list of strings separated by a custom separator.
Execution:
  Arrange: A file with strings separated by a custom separator will be created.
  Act: The function will be invoked using the filename of the created file and the custom separator.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a list of strings. The list will be compared with the expected list.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle a custom separator. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: File Does Not Exist
Details:
  TestName: test_file_does_not_exist
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the scenario when the file does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the file does not exist.
  Act: The function will be invoked using a filename that does not exist.
  Assert: An exception is expected to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle error conditions. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Empty File
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_file
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the scenario when the file is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty file will be created.
  Act: The function will be invoked using the filename of the created empty file.
  Assert: The expected outcome is an empty list.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications.

Scenario 5: File with Whitespaces Only
Details:
  TestName: test_file_with_whitespaces_only
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles the scenario when the file contains whitespaces only.
Execution:
  Arrange: A file with whitespaces only will be created.
  Act: The function will be invoked using the filename of the created file.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a list with a single empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications.
