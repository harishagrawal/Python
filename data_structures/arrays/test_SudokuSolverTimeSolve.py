Scenario 1: Testing the time efficiency of the solve function
Details:
  TestName: test_solve_time_efficiency
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the solve function is time efficient. The solve function should be able to solve the sudoku puzzle within a reasonable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a complex unsolved grid.
  Act: Invoke the time_solve function with the complex unsolved grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the time taken to solve the grid is within the acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the solve function is efficient and can solve complex puzzles within a reasonable time. The time taken to solve the grid is directly related to the function's efficiency.

Scenario 2: Testing the correct execution of the solve function
Details:
  TestName: test_solve_function_execution
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the solve function correctly solves the sudoku puzzle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an unsolved grid.
  Act: Invoke the time_solve function with the unsolved grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the returned values are a solved sudoku grid.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the solve function is correctly solving the sudoku puzzle. The correctness of the solved grid is directly related to the function's ability to solve the puzzle.

Scenario 3: Testing the display of long execution times
Details:
  TestName: test_display_long_execution_times
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly displays puzzles that take long enough to solve.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a complex unsolved grid that is expected to take a long time to solve.
  Act: Invoke the time_solve function with the complex unsolved grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function is correctly displaying the grid and the time taken to solve it.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly displaying puzzles that take a long time to solve. This is important for monitoring the function's performance and identifying potential areas for optimization.

Scenario 4: Testing the function with an already solved grid
Details:
  TestName: test_already_solved_grid
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles an already solved grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a solved grid.
  Act: Invoke the time_solve function with the solved grid as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly identifies the grid as already solved and returns a time of 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles already solved grids. This is important for preventing unnecessary computations and improving function efficiency.
